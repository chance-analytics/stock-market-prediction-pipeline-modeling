    "In this milestone, I scraped the world event data from Wikipedia using web scraping techniques, specifically the beautifulsoup library. After extracting the from Wikipedia and turning it into the DataFrame, I made several changes to the data to ensure it was structured and cleaned for analysis later, including standardizing event dates, removing citation numbering and white spaces, filling null values and checking duplications, lower case text fields and consolidating events for each day. The data transformations involved assumptions about how events were categorized, particularly handling days with multiple events. These assumptions could introduce bias if not all events were captured equally, or if some events were prioritized over others due to their placement in the HTML source.\n",

    "One ethical risk is that scraping content without verifying its accuracy could propagate misinformation or incomplete information. Although Wikipedia is considered reliable by many, it is not considered an authoritative source, and data derived from it should be cross-referenced with more credible datasets when possible, or at  least spot validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, citation numbers and formatting artifacts were removed, assuming they were irrelevant for the analysis. While this improves text processing, it may inadvertently strip context that could have been important for certain types of analyses, such as tracking sources of information.\n",
    "The data was sourced ethically through public access to Wikipedia, but to mitigate potential issues, cross-verification with trusted sources or regular updates of the dataset should be considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, transparent documentation of cleaning steps should be maintained, and I should emphasize the ethical and responsible use of the data to avoid misuse of the data."
