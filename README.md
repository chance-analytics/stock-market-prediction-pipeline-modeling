# Stock Market Prediction Pipeline & Modeling (Two Versions)

This repository contains **two separate builds** of a stock-market analytics project:

- **Version 1 — ETL + SQLite Integration**  
  Focuses on data ingestion, cleaning, and storage. It unifies **FRED macro data**, **Wikipedia world events**, and **Yahoo Finance (yfinance) market data** into a structured **SQLite database** (`finalproject.db`).  
  ➜ See: `Version 1/README.md`

- **Version 2 — Modeling + Evaluation (SPY Next-Day Direction)**  
  Focuses on feature engineering (technical indicators + event sentiment), model training, and time-based evaluation to predict **next-day SPY direction**.  
  ➜ See: `Version 2/README.md`
